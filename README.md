## Game Rules:

The deck has 63 distict cards. At any given time, the top 7 cards are
displayed. The goal is to collect legal subsets (prosets) of the
upcards until the deck is empty. Every time a proset is taken, the
upcards are re-stocked from the deck.

A legal set is one such that there are an even number of every
position of dot. Another way to think of it is that each card
represents a number in binary. A proset is one that reduces to zero
with XOR.

Click a card to select/deselect. Double click the table to submit.
If your submission is invalid, your cards will be deselected. Otherwise,
new cards will appear as long as the deck is non-empty.
